# LuckyNumberGame
Python "game" to give you a "Lucky Number" based on randomized questions

REQUIREMENTS:

Python 3.0 or newer. (Stable version will always be optimized to run with Python 2 also. However, take caution with running 
the unstable version if you're running linux, as linux by default runs the "python" command with Python2). 

NOTE IF RUNNING LINUX: 
run from Terminal with command "Python3" or else program will run in python2. (Only applies to Ubuntu 18.04)
