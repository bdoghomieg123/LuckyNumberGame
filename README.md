# LuckyNumberGame
Python "game" to give you a "Lucky Number" based on randomized questions

REQUIREMENTS:

Python 3.0 or newer. (Stable version will always be optimized to run with Python 2 also. However, take caution with running 
the unstable version if you're running linux, as linux by default runs the "python" command with Python2). 

NOTE IF RUNNING LINUX: 
run from Terminal with command "Python3" or else program will run in python2. (Only applies to Ubuntu 18.04)


How to run:
-Install Python3 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

-Go into command prompt (or terminal if running linux), cd to the directory you have the program in and type "Python [name of file]"

-Enjoy!
